            <p>tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.[2] Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is held largely behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of the state of emergency.[b] Despite being rescheduled for 2021, the event retains the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes.[3] This is the first time that the Olympic Games have been postponed and rescheduled, rather than cancelled.[4] The Summer Paralympics will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021, 16 days after the completion of the Olympics.[5]</p>
